# MKS65C-shell

## implemented features

+ command separation w/ semicolons
+ one can be extremely liberal with spaces
    + except for within tokens, quotation marks don't work yet
+ redirection: `>`, `>>`, `&>`, `&>>`, `2>`, `2>>`, `<`

## t o _ d o 

+ cd
+ pipes, both single and multiple
+ colors / a nicer prompt
+ all the keyboard input related stuff would be super fun to do but I'm way behind and out of time, god dammit
